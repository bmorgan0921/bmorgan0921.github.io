    I started this project during the COVID-19 outbreak after sports disappeared and my friend mentioned that he didn't like the songs Spotify was recommending for him. The objective of this application is to use your listening history and machine learning techniques to make song recommendations and was developed using python. Where am I with this project right now? Currently I am in the process of mobile development for this application.

    As fulfillment to complete the Quantitative Trading Strategies course, I worked with a partner to develop a trading strategy that utilizes fundamental, end-of-day, and sentimental data as inputs into a framework that averages the outputs of three machine learning models and attempts to predict next month's performance based on current month's performance.

    I started this project to make a competitive March Madness tournament bracket. The project is developed entirely in python and uses the sportsreference package to obtain the basketball data. The project started with single game score predictions and developed into predicting scores for the entire day and comparing matchup totals to Vegas O/U totals.
