    I started this project during the COVID-19 outbreak after sports disappeared and my friend mentioned that he didn't like the songs Spotify was recommending for him. The objective of this application is to use your listening history and machine learning techniques to make song recommendations and was developed using python. Where am I with this project right now? Currently I am in the process of mobile development for this application.
